## Abstract

Using Google Cardboard, I made the first AR headset experience that does not rely on expensive specialized hardware. By reconstructing and rendering the user's surroundings in VR, the AR MultiPendulum app replicated Microsoft Hololens.

The final product was ARHeadsetKit, a high-level open-source framework for creating AR headset experiences.
