# ARHeadsetKit: Bringing Affordable AR Headset Technology to the Masses

Philip Turner

Published: January 19, 2022

## Abstract

Using Google Cardboard, I made the first AR headset experience that does not rely on expensive specialized hardware. By reconstructing and rendering the user's surroundings in VR, the AR MultiPendulum app replicated Microsoft Hololens. The process of creating the app involved heavy optimization for power efficiency and fixing bugs caused by using a GPU for general-purpose tasks. The final product was ARHeadsetKit, a high-level open-source framework for creating AR headset experiences.
